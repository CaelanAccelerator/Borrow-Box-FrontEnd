## 📚 Learning by Building

This project was built as part of my self-directed learning journey. I developed it while exploring full-stack development with:

- 💻 **Frontend**: Next.js + MUI + Toolpad
- 🔌 **Backend**: Express.js
- 🗄️ **Database**: PostgreSQL

## 🧩 Features

- 🧾 User registration and authentication
- 🎒 Item listings with category filtering
- 📅 Booking system with availability time slots
- 💬 Real-time messaging between users
- 🛒 Rental history and order tracking
- 💳 Billing and payment summaries

This isn’t just a project — it’s a reflection of how I learned hands-on development skills that are often missed in university education.
